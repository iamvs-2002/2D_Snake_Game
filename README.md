# 2D_Snake_Game
A simple 2D Snake Game built in Java.
- The initial length of snake is 3. 
- The snake is controlled with the cursor keys. 
- If the game is finished, the "Game Over" message is displayed in the middle of the frame and the game restarts when spacebar is pressed.

- **Tech Used: Java, Javax/Swing**
- The best part about the project was to learn about Graphics Class in Java and also to learn about the use of KeyEvents and Listeners.
